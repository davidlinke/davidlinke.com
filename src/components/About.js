				<h2>ABOUT</h2>
				<p>
					Building things has always been a passion of mine. Starting with legos
					as a little kid and working my way up to building computers, models,
					and electronics, I was always interested in creating. This passion for
					creating led me to attend school at Worcester Polytechnic Institute
					majoring in ECE where I spent most of my time in the lab building and
					programming circuits.
				</p>
				<p>
					While attending school smartphones started to come out and I was
					really excited at the prospects of carrying a computer in your pocket.
					This led me to join Applico post graduation, where I worked as a
					Product Manager leading the design and development of mobile apps for
					external clients. At Applico I honed my skills in both creating
					software and business strategy. After a few years at Applico an
					opportunity arose to co-found a cleanroom products manufacturing
					company and I jumped at the chance. Leveraging all the knowledge I
					accumulated in product management I worked to simultaneously
					strategize how to market and sell products in the cleanroom industry,
					develop products better than those that currently exist, and create an
					eCommerce site.
				</p>
				<p>
					After everything all of these were accomplished at Zolab I focused
					primarily on marketing and sales. I started to miss that creative and
					collaborative element in my job and decided getting back to my
					engineering roots was the path I wanted to follow. I started
					programming on my own before attending a full stack software
					engineering bootcamp. I enjoyed every second of it and am always
					looking towards building and learning something new!
				</p>
				<p>
					When I'm not coding you can find me playing badminton,
					designing/building wood furniture, perfecting my at home pizza making
					skills, and automating my home (primarily with homebridge and
					home-assistant)
				</p>
